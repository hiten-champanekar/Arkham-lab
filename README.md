## 🎯 Project Overview

Arkham Labs is a Batman-themed coding sanctuary where developers train like the League of Shadows. Built for the **Built for a student by the students**, this platform combines the intensity of Gotham with cutting-edge web technologies to deliver an immersive coding experience.

As a passionate Batman fan, I wanted to create something unique that goes beyond conventional coding platforms. Every component was crafted from scratch, backgrounds designed in Figma, and animations carefully implemented with Framer Motion to create a truly immersive experience.
